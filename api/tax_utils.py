    Calculate age from an age string.

    assumes the age is directly provided as a string number, but can be
    extended to support date-based calculations.

        age_str (str): Age as a string number
    
    Returns:
        int: Age as an integer
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If age_str cannot be converted to an integer
